Convergence tests
=================

Accepting the current state of the domain as being on the converged solution path is accomplished by the following tests

    - Norm Unbalance -- Specifies a tolerance on the norm of the unbalanced load at the current iteration
    - Norm Displacement Increment -- Specifies a tolerance on the norm of the displacement increments at the current iteration
    - Energy Increment -- Specifies a tolerance on the inner product of the unbalanced load and displacement increments at the current iteration
